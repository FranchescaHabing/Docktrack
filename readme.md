# TUP Doctrack: Web-based Printing System

This project was developed to solve the queuing problems with printing services at the Technological University of the Philippines by providing a fast and reliable printing system. 

DocTrack is specifically made for students and employees as it offers a wide range of features that would allow users to conveniently have their files and documents printed.

The users can upload files and choose from different variations including paper size, type, orientation, color, size, and date and time of pickup. The users must indicate the number of pages in the document, the number of copies to print, and choose to leave a note. The user will pay via online payment using GCash and PayMaya. The admin has a dashboard to monitor the orders, products, statistics, order reports, and list of users. The admin can update the order status so that the user will know whether the order is prepared, confirmed, rejected, or completed. The web-based application was developed using Visual Studio Code, MongoDB, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and Bootstrap.
